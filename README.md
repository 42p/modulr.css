You can find v1 docs and examples at: [Modulr.css](https://decorator.io/modulr/)

### Modulr.css soon here :) 

I've included minified css version for those who'd like to test modulr.css before official release.</br>
Download or copy raw file of modulr.min.css, place it into your project folder and then
add the following ```<link>``` element into your page's ```<head>``` before your project's stylesheets. </br>
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="modulr.min.css">
```

modulr.css is using font awesome icon lib, so make sure to include font awesome right above modulr.min.css file.
