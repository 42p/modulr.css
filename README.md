### Modulr.css soon here :) 

I've included minified css version for those who like to test modulr.css before official release.

Just add the following ```<link>``` element into your page's ```<head>``` before your project's stylesheets.
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uloga/modulr/master/modulr.min.css">```

modulr.css is using font awesome icon lib, so make sure to include font awesome right above the modulr.css
